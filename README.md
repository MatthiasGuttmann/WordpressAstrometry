# Wordpress Astrometry.NET Plugin
Welcome to my first Wordpress Plugin. It is an Plugin, that provides a Gutenberg block, which uses astrometry.net for solving an astronomical image.

# What it does
- Solving astronomic images via [astrometry.NET](http://nova.astrometry.net)
- Colored SVG annotations by different catalogues (HD, Bright, NGC, IC, the ones, which are delivered by astrometry.NET)
- Image zoom / monochrome-invert switch
- Astrometry data output (RA,Dec,Field) and photografic details output (frames, exposuretime, date, equipment) below image
- Extended wordpress search (Tags like M101 are stored in customfields)

# How it looks
